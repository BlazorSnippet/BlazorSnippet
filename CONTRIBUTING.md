# Contributing to BlazorSnippet
We value your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting bugs
- Proposing new features
- Joining discussions in issues
- Submitting Pull Requests for fixes or features

## We use GitHub [Pull Requests](https://github.com/BlazorSnippet/BlazorSnippet/pulls) for accepting code changes 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Be consistent with the existing code
3. Make sure your code passes all code style analyzer checks.
4. Write a detailed description of the changes you have made. 
5. Open a pull request.
6. Collaborate with us on finalizing the PR throughout the code review process

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/BlazorSnippet/BlazorSnippet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/BlazorSnippet/BlazorSnippet/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. You can attach a code snippet from the REPL
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Browser with a specific version and running mode (normal/incognito)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

After submitting an issue, come back to it from time to time to check if we need your additional input.

#### Reporting security issues should be done privately

## Proposing new features
When submitting a new feature request, ensure you include the detailed use cases you want to achieve. If you have a specific point of view of how this feature should look like do not hesitate to add it.
